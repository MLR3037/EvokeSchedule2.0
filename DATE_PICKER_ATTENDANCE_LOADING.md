# Date Picker Attendance Loading Feature

## Overview
When switching dates using the date picker, the system now loads and restores both the schedule AND the attendance data that was saved for that date.

## Problem Before
**Previous Behavior:**
- When changing to a previous date, the schedule would load
- BUT attendance data (absent/out of session flags) was always cleared
- You couldn't see who was absent on past dates
- Had to manually re-mark absences if reviewing a past date

## Solution

### What Happens Now When Changing Dates

#### **Step 1: Save Current Date's Data**
Before switching dates, the system saves:
- Attendance history for the current date to `DailyAttendance` list
- All staff and student attendance flags

#### **Step 2: Clear Local State**
Temporarily clears all attendance flags in the UI to prevent confusion

#### **Step 3: Update Date**
Changes to the new date

#### **Step 4: Load Schedule**
Loads the schedule for the new date from `ScheduleHistory` and `DailyAssignments`

#### **Step 5: Load Attendance (NEW!)**
Loads attendance data from `DailyAttendance` for the new date:
- Queries SharePoint for attendance records matching the date
- Groups records by person type (Staff/Client)
- Applies attendance flags to staff and students

#### **Step 6: Apply to UI**
Updates the UI to show both:
- âœ… Schedule assignments
- âœ… Who was absent/out of session on that date

## Technical Implementation

### New Method: `loadAttendanceForDate(date)`

**File: `src/services/SharePointService.js`**

```javascript
async loadAttendanceForDate(date) {
  const dateStr = date.toISOString().split('T')[0];
  
  // Query DailyAttendance list
  const attendanceUrl = `${this.siteUrl}/_api/web/lists/getbytitle('DailyAttendance')/items?` +
    `$filter=AttendanceDate eq '${dateStr}'&` +
    `$select=PersonType,PersonID,PersonName,Status,AbsentAM,AbsentPM,AbsentFullDay,OutOfSessionAM,OutOfSessionPM,OutOfSessionFullDay`;
  
  // Returns grouped data: { staff: {...}, students: {...} }
}
```

### Updated: `handleDateChange()`

**File: `src/App.js`**

```javascript
// After loading schedule...
const attendanceData = await sharePointService.loadAttendanceForDate(newDate);

if (attendanceData) {
  // Apply attendance to staff
  const staffWithAttendance = staff.map(s => {
    const attendance = attendanceData.staff[s.id];
    if (attendance) {
      return new Staff({
        ...s,
        absentAM: attendance.absentAM,
        absentPM: attendance.absentPM,
        absentFullDay: attendance.absentFullDay,
        // ... etc
      });
    }
    return s;
  });
  
  // Apply attendance to students (same pattern)
  // Update UI
}
```

## User Experience

### Scenario 1: Switch to Past Date with Saved Data

**Example: Go from 10/30 to 10/29**

1. **Current view (10/30)**: Some people marked absent
2. **Click date picker** â†’ Select 10/29
3. **System saves** 10/30 attendance to SharePoint
4. **System loads** 10/29 schedule + attendance
5. **Display shows**: 10/29 schedule with people who were absent on 10/29

### Scenario 2: Switch to Future Date (No Saved Data)

**Example: Go from 10/30 to 11/1**

1. **Current view (10/30)**: Some people marked absent
2. **Click date picker** â†’ Select 11/1
3. **System saves** 10/30 attendance to SharePoint
4. **System loads** 11/1 schedule (if any) + attendance
5. **No attendance found**: Everyone marked present (clean slate)

### Scenario 3: Switch Between Multiple Past Dates

**Example: 10/29 â†’ 10/28 â†’ 10/29**

- Each switch saves current attendance
- Each switch loads saved attendance for target date
- Can review historical data accurately
- Changes to past attendance can be saved

## Console Output

When switching dates, you'll see:

```
ðŸ“… Date changed from Wed Oct 30 2025 to Tue Oct 29 2025
ðŸ’¾ Saving attendance history for Wed Oct 30 2025
âœ… Saved 45/45 attendance records
ðŸ§¹ Clearing attendance in SharePoint...
âœ… SharePoint attendance cleared
âœ… Local attendance state cleared for 15 staff and 30 students
ðŸ“¥ Loading saved schedule for: Tue Oct 29 2025
âœ… Schedule loaded successfully: 88 assignments
ðŸ“¥ Loading attendance data for Tue Oct 29 2025
âœ… Found 45 attendance records for 2025-10-29
ðŸ“Š Loaded attendance: 15 staff, 30 clients
âœ… Attendance data loaded, applying to staff and students
âœ… Attendance data applied to UI
```

## Benefits

âœ… **Historical Accuracy**: See exactly who was absent on any past date  
âœ… **No Data Loss**: Attendance is preserved when switching dates  
âœ… **Review Capability**: Can review past schedules with accurate attendance  
âœ… **Audit Trail**: Complete history of daily attendance in SharePoint  
âœ… **Seamless UX**: Automatic loading, no manual steps needed  

## Edge Cases Handled

### No Attendance Data
If switching to a date with no saved attendance:
- Everyone marked as present (clean slate)
- Console shows: "No attendance data found for this date"
- Can mark absences and save for that date

### Partial Attendance Data
If some people have attendance records but others don't:
- Those with records: Apply saved attendance
- Those without: Mark as present (default)

### Authentication Issues
If not authenticated:
- Skips attendance loading
- Logs warning to console
- Continues with schedule loading

### SharePoint List Missing
If `DailyAttendance` list doesn't exist:
- Gracefully handles error
- Logs warning
- Continues with schedule loading
- Everyone marked present

{
  "d": {
    "results": [
      {

        "PersonName": "John Smith",
        "Status": "Absent AM",
        "AbsentAM": true,

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Basic Date Switch

5. Switch back to 10/30
6. Verify: 10/30 attendance restored correctly

### Test Case 2: Future Date
1. Mark some people absent on 10/30
2. Switch to 11/1 (future)
