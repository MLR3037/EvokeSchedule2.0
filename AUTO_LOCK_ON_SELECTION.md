# Auto-Lock on Selection Feature

## Problem
The UI had inconsistent locking behavior:
- **Main staff**: Showed green lock button → had to click to lock in
- **Trainees**: Showed red unlock button → already locked, could click to unlock

This was confusing because you had to remember to manually lock main staff, but trainees were already auto-locked.

## Solution
Changed main staff selection to **auto-lock** when selected, matching the trainee behavior. Now both main staff and trainees auto-lock on selection.

### Changes Made

**File: `src/components/SchedulingComponents.js`**

1. **Updated `handleStaffSelection` function**:
   - Staff now auto-lock immediately when selected from dropdown
   - No longer uses pre-assignment state - directly creates assignment
   - Paired students automatically get the same staff (as before)
   - Console logging shows "🔒 AUTO-LOCKING" for clarity

2. **Updated dropdown UI**:
   - Removed green "lock" button (no longer needed)
   - Only shows red "unlock" button when staff is assigned
   - Consistent with trainee dropdown behavior

3. **Kept `handleLockAssignment` function**:
   - Still exists for potential backward compatibility
   - Not called in current UI (auto-locking happens in `handleStaffSelection`)

## New Behavior

### Main Staff Assignment
1. **Select staff from dropdown** → ✅ Automatically locked
2. **Click red unlock button** → Removes assignment
3. **Paired students** → Automatically get same staff

### Trainee Assignment
1. **Select trainee from dropdown** → ✅ Automatically locked (unchanged)
2. **Click orange unlock button** → Removes trainee (unchanged)
3. **Paired students** → Automatically get same trainee (unchanged)

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- ❌ Had to remember to click green lock button for main staff
- ✅ Trainees auto-locked
- 😕 Inconsistent behavior between main and trainee

### After
- ✅ Main staff auto-lock on selection
- ✅ Trainees auto-lock on selection
- 😊 Consistent behavior - just select and it's locked!
- 🎯 Only need to click if you want to REMOVE

## Console Output

When staff is selected, you'll see:
```
📝 Staff selected: Student 123, Session AM, Staff 456, Index 0
🔒 AUTO-LOCKING assignment: 456 → Sarah Smith (AM)
✅ Assignment auto-locked successfully
```

For paired students:
```
🔗 LINKED PAIR: Also assigning 456 to pair partner Emma Jones
✅ Pair partner assignment auto-locked: Emma Jones with same staff
```

## Integration with Other Features

This change works seamlessly with:
1. **Paired Student Linking** - Still auto-assigns to pair partners
2. **Training Status** - Trainees still only show in trainee dropdown
3. **Auto-Assignment** - Manual assignments still clearly distinguished from auto-assigned
4. **2:1 Ratios** - Multiple staff dropdowns all auto-lock independently

## Technical Details

### State Management
- **Before**: Used `preAssignments` state to track selections before locking
- **After**: Directly creates assignments on selection (skips pre-assignment step)
- **Result**: Simpler state management, fewer clicks needed

### Disabled Dropdowns
Once staff is assigned (locked), the dropdown becomes disabled and grayed out. To change:
1. Click unlock button to remove
2. Select different staff from dropdown (auto-locks new selection)

## Edge Cases Handled

✅ **Clearing selection**: Selecting blank option doesn't create assignment  
✅ **Double booking**: Validation still prevents same staff being assigned twice  
✅ **Team membership**: Only team members appear in dropdown  
✅ **Training status**: Staff in training only show in trainee dropdown  
✅ **Attendance**: Absent staff don't appear in dropdown  
✅ **Paired students**: Both students get same staff automatically  

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add confirmation dialog before unlocking (prevent accidental removals)
- Visual feedback animation when auto-locking
- Bulk unlock/clear all assignments button
- Undo last unlock action
