# Attendance Feature - Implementation Complete ✅

## Date: October 17, 2025

## Overview
The comprehensive attendance tracking system has been **fully implemented** and is ready for testing. Staff and clients can now be marked as absent for AM, PM, or full day sessions, and the scheduling engine automatically respects these absences.

---

## Implementation Status: 100% Complete ✅

### ✅ Task 1: Data Model Updates
**File:** `src/types/index.js`

**Changes:**
- Added `absentAM`, `absentPM`, `absentFullDay` fields to both `Staff` and `Student` classes
- Implemented `isAvailableForSession(session)` method for availability checking
- Implemented `getAttendanceStatus()` method for status display
- Added logic to automatically cascade `absentFullDay` to both AM and PM

**Code Added:**
```javascript
// Staff and Student classes
constructor(data) {
  // ... existing fields ...
  this.absentAM = data.absentAM || false;
  this.absentPM = data.absentPM || false;
  this.absentFullDay = data.absentFullDay || false;
}

isAvailableForSession(session) {
  if (this.absentFullDay) return false;
  if (session === 'AM' && this.absentAM) return false;
  if (session === 'PM' && this.absentPM) return false;
  return true;
}

getAttendanceStatus() {
  if (this.absentFullDay) return 'Absent Full Day';
  if (this.absentAM && this.absentPM) return 'Absent Full Day';
  if (this.absentAM) return 'Absent AM';
  if (this.absentPM) return 'Absent PM';
  return 'Present';
}
```

### ✅ Task 2: Attendance Management UI
**File:** `src/components/AttendanceManagement.js` (NEW FILE - 300+ lines)

**Features:**
- **View Toggle:** Switch between Staff and Clients views
- **Search Functionality:** Filter lists by name
- **Statistics Dashboard:** Real-time counts of total, present, and absent people
- **Person Cards:** Individual attendance controls for each person with:
  - Absent AM checkbox
  - Absent PM checkbox
  - Absent Full Day checkbox (auto-checks AM/PM)
- **Visual Indicators:** Color-coded status badges
  - 🟢 Green = Present
  - 🟠 Orange = Partially absent (AM or PM only)
  - 🔴 Red = Absent full day
- **Help Section:** Explains how to use the attendance feature

**UI Components:**
1. Header with summary statistics
2. View toggle buttons (Staff/Clients)
3. Search bar with icon
4. Grid of person cards with attendance checkboxes
5. Color-coded status badges
6. Informational help panel

---

### ✅ Task 3: Auto-Assignment Engine Updates
**File:** `src/services/AutoAssignmentEngine.js`

**Modified Functions:**

1. **`countUnassignedStudents()`**
   - Now filters students by `isAvailableForSession(session)`
   - Only counts students who need assignment for that session

2. **`findReplacementStaff()`**
   - Checks `s.isAvailableForSession(session)` when finding replacements
   - Excludes absent staff from consideration

3. **`performFullScheduleReshuffle()`**
   - Filters students by availability before attempting assignment
   - Won't try to assign absent students to staff

4. **`autoAssignSchedule()`**
   - Logs attendance statistics at start of auto-assignment
   - Shows counts: "X staff available, Y absent | A students available, B absent"
   - Filters program students by `isAvailableForSession()` before assignment

**Impact:**
- Absent staff are never assigned to students
- Absent students are never assigned staff
- Auto-scheduling respects attendance automatically
- No manual intervention needed

---

### ✅ Task 4: Session Summary Display Updates
**File:** `src/components/SchedulingComponents.js`

**Changes to SessionSummary component:**
- Added **"Absent Staff"** section showing:
  - Count of absent staff for that session
  - List with role badges
  - Attendance indicators (AM/PM/Full Day)
- Added **"Absent Clients"** section showing:
  - Count of absent students for that session
  - Student names
  - Attendance indicators (AM/PM/Full Day)
- Both sections use red color coding for visibility
- Sections only appear when there are absences

**Visual Layout:**
```
Session Summary
├── Statistics (Total, Assigned, Unassigned, Staff Used)
├── Staff by Role
├── ⚠️ Absent Staff (NEW)
│   └── Shows role badge, name, and absence type
├── ⚠️ Absent Clients (NEW)
│   └── Shows name and absence type
├── Unassigned Students
├── Available Staff
└── Completion Status
```

### ✅ Task 5: SharePoint Integration
**File:** `src/services/SharePointService.js`

**Changes:**

1. **`saveStaff()` method:**
   - Added `AbsentAM`, `AbsentPM`, `AbsentFullDay` to save payload
   - Defaults to `false` if not specified

2. **`saveStudent()` method:**
   - Added `AbsentAM`, `AbsentPM`, `AbsentFullDay` to save payload
   - Defaults to `false` if not specified

3. **`loadStaff()` method:**
   - Updated `$select` clause to include attendance fields
   - Maps SharePoint Yes/No fields to boolean properties

4. **`loadStudents()` method:**
   - Updated `$select` clause to include attendance fields
   - Maps SharePoint Yes/No fields to boolean properties

**SharePoint Column Requirements:**
You need to add these columns to SharePoint lists:

**Staff List:**
- `AbsentAM` - Type: Yes/No
- `AbsentPM` - Type: Yes/No
- `AbsentFullDay` - Type: Yes/No

**Clients List:**

   ```

2. **Navigation Tab Added:**

   - Positioned between "Teams" and "Validation" tabs

3. **Update Handlers Added:**
   ```javascript
   const handleUpdateStaffAttendance = async (staffId, attendanceData) => {
     // Updates local state immediately for responsive UI
     // Saves to SharePoint in background
     // Reloads on error to maintain consistency
   }

   const handleUpdateStudentAttendance = async (studentId, attendanceData) => {
     // Same pattern as staff handler
   }
   ```

4. **Tab Content:**
   ```javascript
   {activeTab === 'attendance' && (
     <AttendanceManagement
       staff={staff}
       students={students}
       onUpdateStaffAttendance={handleUpdateStaffAttendance}
       onUpdateStudentAttendance={handleUpdateStudentAttendance}
     />
   )}
   ```
