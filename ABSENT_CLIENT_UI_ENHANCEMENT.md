# Absent Client UI Enhancement

## Date: October 17, 2025

## Feature Enhancement
Added visual indicator in the Schedule Table when a client is marked absent - their staff assignment dropdown now shows "ABSENT" and is greyed out.

---

## Problem Solved
When a client was marked absent, the staff assignment dropdown still appeared as normal and editable. This could lead to:
- Schedulers accidentally assigning staff to absent clients
- Confusion about who's actually attending
- Wasted effort trying to assign staff to absent students
- No visual indication of absence in the assignment table

---

## Solution Implemented

### Visual Changes in Schedule Table:

**Before (Client Present):**
```
Client Name     | AM Staff Assignment           | PM Staff Assignment
Ada             | [Select staff... ▼]          | [Select staff... ▼]
```

**After (Client Absent):**
```
Client Name     | AM Staff Assignment           | PM Staff Assignment
Ada             | ABSENT  [Absent Full Day]    | ABSENT  [Absent Full Day]
                  (greyed out, uneditable)       (greyed out, uneditable)
```

### Implementation Details:

**Location:** `src/components/SchedulingComponents.js` - `renderStaffDropdown()` function

**Logic Added:**
```javascript
const renderStaffDropdown = (student, session) => {
  // Check if student is absent for this session
  if (!student.isAvailableForSession(session)) {
    return (
      <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
        <div className="text-sm px-3 py-2 bg-gray-100 text-gray-400 rounded border border-gray-200 italic">
          ABSENT
        </div>
        <span className="px-2 py-1 bg-red-100 text-red-600 rounded text-xs font-medium">
          {student.absentFullDay ? 'Full Day' : session === 'AM' ? 'Absent AM' : 'Absent PM'}
        </span>
      </div>
    );
  }
  
  // ... rest of dropdown logic for present students
};
```

---

## Visual Design

### "ABSENT" Display:
- **Background:** Light grey (`bg-gray-100`)
- **Text:** Grey, italic (`text-gray-400 italic`)
- **Style:** Rounded box with border
- **Padding:** Similar to dropdown for visual consistency

### Absence Badge:
- **Background:** Light red (`bg-red-100`)
- **Text:** Red (`text-red-600`)
- **Content:** Shows specific absence type
  - "Full Day" if `absentFullDay` is true
  - "Absent AM" if absent only in morning
  - "Absent PM" if absent only in afternoon
- **Size:** Small badge (`text-xs`)

## User Experience

### Before Enhancement:
1. Mark client as absent in Attendance tab
2. Go to Schedule tab
3. See normal dropdown for that client ❌
4. Could accidentally assign staff ❌
5. No visual indication of absence ❌

### After Enhancement:
1. Mark client as absent in Attendance tab
2. Go to Schedule tab
3. See "ABSENT" in grey box ✅
4. Cannot assign staff (not interactive) ✅
5. Clear badge shows absence type ✅
6. Immediately obvious who's missing ✅

## Behavior by Absence Type

### Full Day Absence:
```
AM Session: ABSENT [Full Day]
PM Session: ABSENT [Full Day]
```

### AM Only Absence:
```
AM Session: ABSENT [Absent AM]
PM Session: [Select staff... ▼]  ← Normal dropdown
```

### PM Only Absence:
```
AM Session: [Select staff... ▼]  ← Normal dropdown
PM Session: ABSENT [Absent PM]
```

---

## Technical Details

### Check Order:
1. **First:** Check if student is available for session
2. **If absent:** Return "ABSENT" display (early exit)
3. **If present:** Continue with normal dropdown logic

### Method Used:
```javascript
student.isAvailableForSession(session)
```

This method (from `types/index.js`) checks:
- If `absentFullDay` is true → not available
- If `session === 'AM'` and `absentAM` is true → not available
- If `session === 'PM'` and `absentPM` is true → not available
- Otherwise → available

### Styling Classes:
```javascript
// "ABSENT" text
className="text-sm px-3 py-2 bg-gray-100 text-gray-400 rounded border border-gray-200 italic"

// Absence badge
className="px-2 py-1 bg-red-100 text-red-600 rounded text-xs font-medium"

// Container
className="flex items-center gap-2"
```

## Files Modified

**1. `src/components/SchedulingComponents.js`**
- Modified `renderStaffDropdown()` function
- Added absence check at the beginning
- Returns greyed-out "ABSENT" display instead of dropdown

---

## Integration with Other Features

### Works With:
1. **Attendance Tab** - Mark client absent
2. **Session Summaries** - Shows in "Absent Clients" section
3. **Auto-Assignment** - Won't assign staff to absent clients
4. **Available Staff** - Absent clients removed from unassigned list
5. **Schedule Table** - Shows "ABSENT" (this feature)

### Consistent Behavior:
- All features respect `isAvailableForSession()` method
- Single source of truth for absence status
- Changes in Attendance tab immediately reflect in Schedule table

---

## Screenshots

### Example: Ada marked absent Full Day

**Primary Program:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Client    │ AM Staff Assignment  │ PM Staff Assignment │
├───────────┼─────────────────────┼────────────────────┤
│ Ada       │ ABSENT [Full Day]   │ ABSENT [Full Day]  │
│ (1:1)     │                     │                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Absent Clients Summary:**
```
Absent Clients (1):
- Ada (Full Day)
```

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Partial Day Absence:
**Scenario:** Client absent AM only  
**Result:** AM shows "ABSENT", PM shows normal dropdown  

### 2. Full Day Absence:
**Scenario:** Client absent all day  
**Result:** Both AM and PM show "ABSENT [Full Day]"  

### 3. Already Assigned Before Marked Absent:
**Scenario:** Staff assigned, then client marked absent  
**Result:** Shows "ABSENT", existing assignment removed by auto-engine  

### 4. Toggling Absence:
**Scenario:** Mark absent, then unmark  
**Result:** Dropdown returns immediately, can assign staff

## Summary

When a client is marked absent in the Attendance tab, their staff assignment dropdowns in the Schedule table now display:

1. **"ABSENT"** text in italicized grey
2. **Absence badge** showing the type (AM/PM/Full Day)
3. **Non-interactive** (can't accidentally assign staff)
4. **Visually distinct** from active dropdowns

This enhancement provides immediate visual feedback, prevents assignment errors, and improves the overall user experience of the attendance feature.

**Result:** Clear, professional indication that prevents scheduling errors and saves time!
