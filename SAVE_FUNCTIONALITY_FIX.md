# Save Functionality Fix - October 17, 2025

## Issue
Team edits were not being saved to:
1. The application state (UI not updating)
2. SharePoint list (data not persisting)

## Root Causes Found

### 1. Missing Team Field in SharePoint Save
**File:** `src/services/SharePointService.js` - `saveStudent()` method

**Problem:** The method was only saving basic fields and completely ignoring the `team` field.

**Before:**
```javascript
const body = {
  __metadata: { type: 'SP.Data.ClientsListItem' },
  Title: student.name,
  Program: student.program,
  RatioAM: student.ratioAM,
  RatioPM: student.ratioPM,
  IsActive: student.isActive
  // ❌ Team field missing!
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Prepare team field for SharePoint People Picker
const teamResults = student.team && student.team.length > 0
  ? student.team.map(person => person.id || person.userId).filter(id => id)
  : [];

const body = {
  __metadata: { type: 'SP.Data.ClientsListItem' },
  Title: student.name,
  Program: student.program,
  RatioAM: student.ratioAM,
  RatioPM: student.ratioPM,
  IsActive: student.isActive,
  TeamId: { results: teamResults } // ✅ People Picker field properly formatted
};
```

### 2. Modal Not Closing After Edit
**File:** `src/App.js` - `handleEditStudent()` method

**Problem:** Modal state (`showAddStudent`) was never set to `false`, so modal stayed open even after successful save.

**Before:**
```javascript
const handleEditStudent = async (studentData) => {
  try {
    const updatedStudent = new Student({ ...studentData, id: editingStudent.id });
    await sharePointService.saveStudent(updatedStudent, true);
    await loadData();
    setEditingStudent(null); // ❌ Modal stays open!
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error updating student:', error);
  }
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
const handleEditStudent = async (studentData) => {
  setSaving(true);
  try {
    const updatedStudent = new Student({ ...studentData, id: editingStudent.id });
    await sharePointService.saveStudent(updatedStudent, true);
    await loadData();
    setEditingStudent(null);
    setShowAddStudent(false); // ✅ Close modal
    alert('Student updated successfully!'); // ✅ User feedback
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error updating student:', error);
    alert(`Failed to update student: ${error.message}`); // ✅ Error feedback
  } finally {
    setSaving(false); // ✅ Clear saving state
  }
};
```

## Additional Improvements Made

### Consistent Save Handlers
Applied the same improvements to all save handlers for consistency:

1. **handleAddStudent** - Added modal close, alerts, and loading state
2. **handleAddStaff** - Added modal close, alerts, and loading state
3. **handleEditStaff** - Added modal close, alerts, and loading state

## SharePoint People Picker Format

The team field is saved to SharePoint as:
```javascript
TeamId: { results: [12, 34, 56] } // Array of user IDs
```

This matches SharePoint's People Picker multi-user field format where:
- `TeamId` is the internal field name (appended with "Id" for the ID field)
- `results` is an array of user IDs
- Each ID corresponds to a SharePoint user

## Testing Checklist

### Local Testing (App State)
- [x] Edit student from Teams tab
- [x] Modify team members in People Picker
- [x] Click "Update Student"
- [x] Verify modal closes
- [x] Verify success message shows
- [x] Verify Teams tab reflects changes

### SharePoint Testing
- [ ] Edit student and save
- [ ] Check SharePoint Clients list
- [ ] Verify "Team" column shows updated members
- [ ] Reload app and verify data persists
- [ ] Check that team IDs are correctly saved

## Files Modified

1. **src/services/SharePointService.js**
   - Added team field to saveStudent method
   - Properly formats team data for SharePoint People Picker

2. **src/App.js**
   - Fixed handleEditStudent to close modal
   - Added user feedback (success/error alerts)
   - Added saving state management
   - Applied same fixes to all CRUD handlers

## Next Steps

1. **Test with actual SharePoint connection** - Connect to live SharePoint and verify team updates persist
2. **Verify People Picker field name** - Confirm SharePoint field is named "Team" (internal name likely "TeamId")
3. **Test error handling** - Verify error messages show when save fails
4. **Test loading states** - Verify UI shows loading indicator during save

## Notes

- The `team` array in the Student object contains full People Picker objects with `{id, title, email}`
- SharePoint only needs the user IDs, so we extract them: `team.map(person => person.id)`
- The `filter(id => id)` removes any null/undefined IDs
- SharePoint expects the format `{ results: [ids] }` for multi-user fields
