# Client Team Members Deletion Fix

## Issue
When deleting client/team member records from the ClientTeamMembers SharePoint list, the deleted records were still appearing in the app's Teams tab, even after clicking Refresh.

## Root Cause
The app had a **fallback mechanism** that was incorrectly triggering:

1. **Priority 1**: Load teams from ClientTeamMembers list (new method)
2. **Fallback**: If ClientTeamMembers data was empty for a client, fall back to legacy Team field in Clients list

### The Problem
When you deleted a record from ClientTeamMembers, the app saw "no data for this client in ClientTeamMembers" and **incorrectly fell back** to reading the old Team field data from the Clients list. The old Team field hadn't been cleared, so deleted team members kept appearing.

## Solution
Changed the logic to distinguish between:
- **ClientTeamMembers list doesn't exist** (404 error) → Use legacy Team field
- **ClientTeamMembers list exists but is empty for a client** → Use empty array (no team members)

### Code Changes

**SharePointService.js - `loadClientTeamMembers()` method:**
```javascript
// OLD: Returned empty object {} when list didn't exist
return {}; // Falls back to legacy method incorrectly

// NEW: Returns null when list doesn't exist
return null; // Signals that list doesn't exist, use legacy
```

**SharePointService.js - `parseStudents()` method:**
```javascript
// OLD: Checked if teamsByClient[item.Id] had data
if (teamsByClient[item.Id] && teamsByClient[item.Id].length > 0) {
  // Use ClientTeamMembers data
} else if (item.Team) {
  // Fall back to legacy Team field
}

// NEW: Checks if ClientTeamMembers list exists at all
const useClientTeamMembersList = teamsByClient !== null;

if (useClientTeamMembersList) {
  // Use ClientTeamMembers data (even if empty)
  team = teamsByClient[item.Id] || [];
} else if (item.Team) {
  // Only use legacy Team field if ClientTeamMembers list doesn't exist
}
```

## Behavior After Fix

### If ClientTeamMembers List Exists:
- ✅ App uses ONLY ClientTeamMembers list data
- ✅ Deletions from ClientTeamMembers immediately reflect after refresh
- ✅ Empty teams show as empty (no fallback to old data)
- ❌ Legacy Team field is ignored completely

### If ClientTeamMembers List Doesn't Exist (404):
- ✅ App falls back to legacy Team field in Clients list
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ System works during migration period

## Testing
1. ✅ Delete a team member from ClientTeamMembers list in SharePoint
2. ✅ Click Refresh button in the app
3. ✅ Verify the deleted team member no longer appears in Teams tab
4. ✅ Verify remaining team members still display correctly

## Migration Note
If you're still using the legacy Team field, you should:
1. Complete migration to ClientTeamMembers list
2. Verify all teams are correct in the new list
3. (Optional) Clear the old Team field data in the Clients list

The old Team field is now ignored by the app if ClientTeamMembers list exists.
