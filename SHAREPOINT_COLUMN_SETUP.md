## Testing After Setup

1. **Open the App:**
   - Navigate to your app (localhost:3000 or deployed URL)
   - Sign in with your credentials

2. **Test Load:**
   - Go to Staff tab - verify staff load correctly
   - Go to Students tab - verify students load correctly
   - Check browser console for any errors

3. **Test Attendance Tab:**
   - Click "Attendance" tab
   - Switch between Staff and Clients views
   - Search should work

4. **Test Save:**
   - Mark a staff member as Absent AM
   - Wait a few seconds
   - Go to SharePoint Staff list
   - Verify the AbsentAM column is checked for that person

5. **Test Load:**
   - Refresh the browser
   - Go to Attendance tab
   - Verify the absence is still marked

6. **Test Auto-Assignment:**
   - Mark a staff member as Absent Full Day
   - Go to Schedule tab
   - Click Auto-Assign
   - Verify the absent staff member is NOT assigned to any students

7. **Test Session Summaries:**
   - Mark a client as Absent AM
   - Go to Schedule tab
   - Check the AM Primary summary
   - Verify the client appears in "Absent Clients" section

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Column 'AbsentAM' does not exist"

**Solution:**
- Verify column name is exactly `AbsentAM` (case-sensitive)
- Verify column exists in the correct list (Staff or Clients)
- Try refreshing the SharePoint list page

### Problem: Attendance doesn't save

**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify you have edit permissions on Staff/Clients lists
- Verify column types are Yes/No (not Choice or Text)
- Check that SharePointService is authenticated

### Problem: Attendance doesn't load

**Solution:**
- Verify columns exist in SharePoint
- Check that the $select clause includes the attendance fields
- Look for errors in browser console
- Try signing out and back in

### Problem: Auto-assignment still assigns absent people

**Solution:**
- Verify the person is actually marked absent in the app
- Check that isAvailableForSession() method is working
- Look in console for "Attendance stats" log message
- Verify the attendance was saved to SharePoint

## Alternative: PowerShell Script

If you prefer, you can add columns via PowerShell:

```powershell
# Connect to SharePoint
Connect-PnPOnline -Url "https://evokebehavioralhealthcom.sharepoint.com/sites/Clinistrators"

# Add columns to Staff list
Add-PnPField -List "Staff" -DisplayName "AbsentAM" -InternalName "AbsentAM" -Type Boolean -AddToDefaultView
Add-PnPField -List "Staff" -DisplayName "AbsentPM" -InternalName "AbsentPM" -Type Boolean -AddToDefaultView
Add-PnPField -List "Staff" -DisplayName "AbsentFullDay" -InternalName "AbsentFullDay" -Type Boolean -AddToDefaultView

# Add columns to Clients list
Add-PnPField -List "Clients" -DisplayName "AbsentAM" -InternalName "AbsentAM" -Type Boolean -AddToDefaultView
Add-PnPField -List "Clients" -DisplayName "AbsentPM" -InternalName "AbsentPM" -Type Boolean -AddToDefaultView
Add-PnPField -List "Clients" -DisplayName "AbsentFullDay" -InternalName "AbsentFullDay" -Type Boolean -AddToDefaultView

Write-Host "Attendance columns added successfully!" -ForegroundColor Green
```
