**Date:** October 20, 2025

## Summary
Successfully implemented a comprehensive staff training management system with color-coded visual indicators and zero impact on existing auto-assignment functionality.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Data Model Updates** âœ…
- Added `TRAINING_STATUS` constants to `types/index.js`
- Added `teamTrainingStatus` field to Student class
- Added helper methods:
  - `getStaffTrainingStatus(staffId)` - Get training status
  - `setStaffTrainingStatus(staffId, status)` - Update status
  - `isStaffCertified(staffId)` - Check certification

### 2. **Visual Badges in Schedule Tab** âœ…
- Updated `SchedulingComponents.js` to show training badges
- **Red Badge** ðŸ”´ with graduation cap icon = "Staff Overlap"
- **Yellow Badge** ðŸŸ¡ with graduation cap icon = "BCBA Overlap"
- **No Badge** = Certified or Solo (clean display)
- Badges appear next to staff names in "Full Team" column

### 3. **Training Management Tab** âœ…

- Features:
  - Statistics dashboard (Total, Staff Overlap, BCBA Overlap, Certified, Solo)
  - Student search functionality
  - Program filtering (Primary/Secondary/All)
  - Dropdown status selectors for each staff-student pair

### 4. **App Integration** âœ…

### 5. **SharePoint Integration** âœ…

- Automatic save on status change
- Local state updates immediately (responsive UI)

## Training Status Options

1. **ðŸ”´ Staff Overlap** (`overlap-staff`)
   - New staff needs to shadow existing team members
   - 3-5 sessions typical duration

2. **ðŸŸ¡ BCBA Overlap** (`overlap-bcba`)
   - Staff completed staff overlaps, needs BCBA oversight
   - 2-3 sessions typical duration

3. **ðŸŸ¢ Certified** (`certified`)
   - Fully trained, can work independently
   - No badge displayed (clean UI)

4. **Solo** (`solo`)
   - Default status for existing team members
   - No training tracking needed

## SharePoint Setup Required

### Add Column to Clients List:
- **Column Name:** `TeamTrainingStatus`
- **Type:** Multiple lines of text (Plain text)
- **Purpose:** Stores training status JSON: `{"23": "overlap-staff", "45": "certified"}`
