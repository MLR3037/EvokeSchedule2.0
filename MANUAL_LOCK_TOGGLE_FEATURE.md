# Manual Lock Toggle Feature

## Overview
Updated the locking functionality to allow users to manually toggle lock status on any assignment, including auto-assigned staff. This gives users full control over which assignments are protected from the "Clear Unlocked" button.

## Problem
**Before:**
- Auto-assigned staff showed green unlock icon but couldn't be locked
- Manually selected staff from dropdown were immediately locked (red icon)
- No way to lock auto-assigned staff to protect them from "Clear Unlocked"
- Dropdown was disabled once assignment was made, couldn't easily change selection

**User Request:**
- Auto-assigned staff should show green icon (unlocked)
- Clicking green icon should lock them (turn red)
- Clicking red icon should unlock and remove assignment
- Dropdown should remain accessible so user can change selection
- Only clicking the lock button should lock, not just selecting from dropdown

## Solution

### Changes Made

**File: `src/components/SchedulingComponents.js`**

#### 1. Updated Lock/Unlock Button Logic
```javascript
{currentAssignment && (
  <button
    onClick={() => {
      if (currentAssignment.isLocked) {
        // If locked, unlock and remove assignment
        handleUnlockAssignment(student.id, session, staffIndex);
      } else {
        // If unlocked (auto-assigned), lock it to protect from Clear Unlocked
        onAssignmentLock(currentAssignment.id);
      }
    }}
    className={`p-1 rounded ${
      currentAssignment.isLocked 
        ? 'text-red-600 hover:text-red-800 hover:bg-red-50' 
        : 'text-green-600 hover:text-green-800 hover:bg-green-50'
    }`}
    title={currentAssignment.isLocked ? 'Unlock and remove assignment' : 'Lock assignment (protect from Clear Unlocked)'}
  >
    {currentAssignment.isLocked ? (
      <Lock className="w-4 h-4" />
    ) : (
      <Unlock className="w-4 h-4" />
    )}
  </button>
)}
```

**What it does:**
- Green icon (unlocked): Click to LOCK the assignment
- Red icon (locked): Click to UNLOCK and REMOVE the assignment

#### 2. Removed Auto-Lock on Selection
```javascript
const handleStaffSelection = (studentId, session, staffId, staffIndex = 0) => {
  // ... code ...
  
  // Create assignment but DO NOT auto-lock (user must click lock icon to lock)
  onManualAssignment({
    staffId: parsedStaffId,
    studentId: studentId,
    session: session,
    program: student.program
  });
  
  // Removed: setLockedAssignments(prev => new Set([...prev, key]));
  
  console.log(`‚úÖ Assignment created (unlocked - click lock icon to protect from Clear Unlocked)`);
}
```

**What it does:**
- Selecting from dropdown creates assignment but doesn't lock it
- User must click the green lock icon to lock the assignment

#### 3. Enabled Dropdown Even With Assignment
```javascript
<select
  value={selectedStaffId}
  onChange={(e) => handleStaffSelection(student.id, session, e.target.value, staffIndex)}
  disabled={false}  // Changed from: disabled={!!currentAssignment}
  className={...}
>
```

**What it does:**
- Dropdown stays enabled even after assignment is made
- User can change selection easily

#### 4. Handle Assignment Replacement
```javascript
if (studentAssignments.length > staffIndex) {
  // Remove existing assignment before creating new one
  const existingAssignment = studentAssignments[staffIndex];
  console.log(`üîÑ Replacing existing assignment ${existingAssignment.staffName} with new selection`);
  onAssignmentRemove(existingAssignment.id);
}
```

**What it does:**
- When changing selection in dropdown, removes old assignment before creating new one
- Prevents duplicate assignments

**File: `src/App.js`**

#### 5. Changed Manual Assignment Default to Unlocked
```javascript
const assignment = new Assignment({
  // ... other fields ...
  isLocked: false, // Changed from: true
  assignedBy: 'manual'
});
```

**What it does:**
- All assignments (manual and auto) start unlocked
- User must explicitly lock them by clicking the lock icon

## New Behavior

### 1. Auto-Assigned Staff (Green Icon)
- **After auto-assign**: Staff show green unlock icon
- **Click green icon**: Turns red (locked), protected from "Clear Unlocked"
- **Click red icon**: Unlocks and removes assignment

### 2. Manual Selection from Dropdown
- **Select staff**: Creates unlocked assignment (green icon)
- **Change selection**: Removes old assignment, creates new unlocked one
- **Click green icon**: Locks the assignment (red icon)
- **Dropdown stays enabled**: Can change selection anytime

### 3. Clear Unlocked Button
- **Removes**: All assignments with green icon (unlocked)
- **Keeps**: All assignments with red icon (locked)
- **User control**: Lock any assignment you want to keep

### 4. Paired Students
- When assigning staff to a paired student, both students get assignment
- Both assignments start unlocked (green icons)
- User can lock either or both independently

## User Experience

### Workflow Example

1. **Auto-Assign Schedule**
   - All assignments show green unlock icons

2. **Review Assignments**
   - See which assignments you like
   - Click green icon on assignments you want to keep ‚Üí turns red

3. **Clear Unlocked**
   - Removes all green (unlocked) assignments
   - Keeps all red (locked) assignments

4. **Manual Adjustments**
   - Select different staff from dropdown if needed
   - Click green icon to lock when happy with selection

5. **Re-run Auto-Assign**
   - Locked assignments (red) are preserved
   - Only unlocked positions get new assignments

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Full Control**: Lock any assignment, whether auto or manual  
‚úÖ **Easy Changes**: Dropdown stays enabled, change selections easily  
‚úÖ **Selective Clearing**: Keep specific auto-assignments by locking them  
‚úÖ **Consistent Behavior**: All assignments work the same way  
‚úÖ **Visual Clarity**: Green = unlocked/temporary, Red = locked/protected  

## Icon Legend

| Icon | Color | Status | Action When Clicked |
|------|-------|--------|---------------------|
| üîì Unlock | Green | Unlocked (auto or manual) | Locks the assignment |
| üîí Lock | Red | Locked (protected) | Unlocks and removes |

## Console Output

When locking an auto-assigned staff:
```
üìù Assignment ID: 123_456_AM_Primary
üîí Locking assignment via icon click
‚úÖ Assignment is now locked and protected
```

When creating assignment from dropdown:
```
üìù Staff selected: Student 123, Session AM, Staff 456, Index 0
üîÑ Replacing existing assignment John Smith with new selection
üìù Creating unlocked assignment: 456 ‚Üí Sarah Smith (AM)
‚úÖ Assignment created (unlocked - click lock icon to protect from Clear Unlocked)
```

## Edge Cases Handled

‚úÖ **Changing dropdown selection**: Removes old assignment before creating new one  
‚úÖ **Paired students**: Both assignments can be locked independently  
‚úÖ **Clear selection**: Removes assignment when selecting blank option  
‚úÖ **2:1 ratios**: Multiple staff dropdowns work independently  
‚úÖ **Lock/unlock toggle**: Can't create duplicate assignments  

## Backward Compatibility

- Old behavior: All manual selections were auto-locked
- New behavior: Nothing is auto-locked, user controls locking
- Migration: Existing locked assignments remain locked
- Clear Unlocked still works as expected (removes unlocked, keeps locked)
