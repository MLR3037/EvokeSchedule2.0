# Teams Edit Fix - October 17, 2025

## Issue
When clicking the edit button on the Teams tab, the app crashed with error:
```
Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {...})
```

## Root Cause
The `PeoplePicker` component was trying to render user objects directly as React children without checking if the values were strings or objects. When the `team` field contained objects with nested properties, React couldn't render them.

## Solution Applied

### Fixed `PeoplePicker.js`

#### 1. Selected Users Display (Lines 113-132)
**Before:**
```javascript
<span>{user.title}</span>
```

**After:**
```javascript
{selectedUsers.map(user => {
  // Safely extract user title/name
  const userName = typeof user.title === 'string' 
    ? user.title 
    : (typeof user.name === 'string' ? user.name : 'Unknown User');
  
  return (
    <div key={user.id || Math.random()} ...>
      <span>{userName}</span>
    </div>
  );
})}
```

#### 2. Search Results Display (Lines 181-205)
**Before:**
```javascript
<div>{user.title}</div>
<div>{user.email}</div>
```

**After:**
```javascript
{availableResults.map(user => {
  const userName = typeof user.title === 'string' 
    ? user.title 
    : (typeof user.name === 'string' ? user.name : 'Unknown');
  const userEmail = typeof user.email === 'string' 
    ? user.email 
    : '';
  
  return (
    <button ...>
      <div>{userName}</div>
      {userEmail && <div>{userEmail}</div>}
    </button>
  );
})}
```

## What This Fixes
1. ✅ **Teams tab edit button** now works without crashing
2. ✅ **People Picker** safely handles both string and object values
3. ✅ **Team member display** shows correctly even with complex data structures
4. ✅ **Student form** can be edited with team assignments

## Team Editing Workflow

### How to Edit Teams from the App:
1. Navigate to the **Teams** tab
2. Find the client in the "Staff by Client" view
3. Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon)
4. In the form, use the **Team Members** section
5. Add/remove staff using the People Picker
6. Click **Update Student** to save

### SharePoint Integration:
When you save the student form:
- The `team` field is updated in the SharePoint **Clients** list
- The **Team** column (People Picker type) is synchronized
- Changes are persisted to SharePoint immediately
- The Teams tab view updates to reflect the new assignments

## Testing
- ✅ Build successful (159.3 KB bundle)
- ✅ No runtime errors
- ✅ People Picker renders correctly
- ✅ Teams can be edited and saved

## Files Modified
- `src/components/PeoplePicker.js` - Added type safety for user objects

## Notes
The fix adds defensive programming to handle cases where SharePoint returns complex objects instead of simple strings. This prevents React rendering errors and makes the component more robust.
